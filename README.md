# User Authentication System

This repository implements a robust user authentication system with the following features:

- **Registration**: Users can create new accounts.
- **Login/Logout**: Users can authenticate and deauthenticate themselves.
- **Profile Management**: Users can view and update their profiles.
- **Password Updates**: Users can change their passwords.

## Security Considerations

- **JWT Tokens**: Authentication is handled using secure JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for session management.
- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: JWTs are stored securely in HTTP-only cookies to prevent client-side script access.

## Backend Protection

- **Protected Routes**: Backend routes are secured to only allow access for authenticated users with valid JWTs.

## Frontend Access Control

- **Private Components**: Frontend components are restricted to logged-in users.

## State Management

- **Redux Toolkit**: Leverages Redux Toolkit for efficient application state management.
